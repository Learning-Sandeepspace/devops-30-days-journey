# DevOps 30 Days Journey (AWS • Linux • Docker • Terraform • CI/CD)

This repository tracks my 30-day DevOps learning and hands-on practice, based on AWS + core DevOps tools.

## Goals

- Build a solid foundation in:
  - AWS (EC2, VPC, S3, IAM, CloudWatch)
  - Linux
  - Docker
  - CI/CD (GitHub Actions / Jenkins)
  - Terraform (IaC)
- Create real, demonstrable projects.
- Maintain a daily habit of:
  - Writing notes
  - Committing to Git
  - Pushing to GitHub
  - Troubleshooting like a DevOps engineer

## Folder Structure

- `day-XX-topic-name/` → Daily learning, notes, and screenshots.
- `projects/` → Bigger, reusable projects (Terraform, Docker, CI/CD, etc).

Example:
- `day-01-aws-basics/` – EC2, S3, IAM, Nginx, Security Groups

## Daily Routine

For each day:
1. Learn the concept (AWS / DevOps topic).
2. Do hands-on in AWS / Linux.
3. Document in `README.md` and `notes.md`.
4. Add screenshots.
5. Commit & push to GitHub.

## Progress

- ✅ Day 01 – AWS Basics (EC2, S3, IAM, Nginx, Security Groups)
- ⏳ Day 02 – VPC & Networking
- (More days will be added as I progress)# DevOps 30 Days Journey (Using Abhishek Playlists)
