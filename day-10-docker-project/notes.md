# Day 10 Notes

- Dockerfile defines how an image is built.
- FROM sets base image.
- COPY adds files into image.
- docker build creates image.
- docker run creates container.
- docker tag renames image for Docker Hub.
- docker push uploads image to registry.

Difference:
Image = blueprint
Container = running instance
